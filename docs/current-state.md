# Current state

Last updated: 2026-07-11.

## Preserved baseline

- Original daily driver: `E:\Claude Code Projects\Personal\PC-SDK`
- Stable repository: `github.com/emersonmccuin-pixel/pc-sdk`
- Annotated tag: `working-v1-2026-07-11`
- Baseline commit: `e233aa54c58dca163e98cf6011e79a0b91bd2d6f`
- Evidence: `pnpm ci:check` passed; `pnpm smoke` completed a live Claude
  Opus turn after the stale smoke harness was repaired.

The original checkout remains the daily driver. New architecture work happens
only in PC-SDK Next.

## Fork identity

- Checkout: `E:\Claude Code Projects\Personal\PC-SDK-Next`
- Repository: `github.com/emersonmccuin-pixel/pc-sdk-next` (private)
- `origin`: PC-SDK Next, fetch and push
- `upstream`: stable PC-SDK, fetch-only (`pushurl=DISABLED`)
- Base branch: `main`
- PF-001 landing merge: `e1667dbae069f1ea62fe4d8e54489927734f2483`
- PF-001 worktree: removed after positive landing proof

Isolation defaults in the planning slice:

| Resource | Working PC-SDK | PC-SDK Next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server | 5123 | 5124 |
| Dev web | 5173/default | 5175 |
| Data | original repo `data` | Next repo `data` |
| Logs | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PC-SDK\logs` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PC-SDK-Next\logs` |
| Shortcut | PC-SDK | PC-SDK Next |
| Browser title | PC-SDK | PC-SDK Next |

## Implemented baseline capabilities

- Browser shell and streaming Claude orchestrator chat
- Canonical runtime seam with `ClaudeRuntimeAdapter`
- Runtime-stamped agent runs and specialist roster
- Typed contracts, deliverables, deterministic verification
- Durable asks/mailbox and agent terminal envelopes
- Mandatory worktree provisioning/readiness, sealed commits, guarded landing,
  teardown, recovery, and lifecycle tests
- Global MCP client/bridge foundation and Claude usage observations
- One-click hidden launcher and boot recovery

## Known architectural gaps

- Composition remains fixed to Claude and model defaults; there is no Codex
  adapter or runtime/model/effort switcher.
- Orchestrator sessions do not yet durably stamp the full runtime/account/model/
  effort selection needed for safe provider-neutral resume.
- Adapter capabilities/model discovery are specified but not implemented.
- Core event/persistence vocabulary still includes Claude-first names such as
  `sdkUuid`, `sdkSessionId`, and a literal Claude provider type.
- User send queue ordering works in-process but the queue is not durable across
  restart.
- Usage DTOs are Claude-shaped and do not retain general source semantics,
  confidence, staleness, or runtime attribution.
- No honest per-session context-use contract exists yet.
- Current thinking events need a policy migration to safe operational activity
  rather than unrestricted reasoning content.
- AInativePM ownership and UI/domain integration have not been jointly audited;
  the old anchoring proposal is provisional.
- Process identity is positive at `/health`, but a data-directory mutex and
  cross-process repository lease do not yet exist; the listener is not yet
  explicitly loopback-bound.
- Runtime/setup subprocesses inherit a broad server environment. A least-
  privilege allowlist/scrub must prevent unrelated app secrets (including PM
  tokens) from reaching providers or repository commands.

## Active work

`PF-001` is complete. `BC-001` is the next read-only baseline-characterization
slice. See `docs/execution/current.md` for the exact next action.
