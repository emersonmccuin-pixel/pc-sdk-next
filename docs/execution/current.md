## Status

CF-002 is complete, guarded-landed, positively ancestry-proven, and torn down.
Ordered live projection is indexed/incremental, stable history uses bounded
persistent chunks, completed raw deltas compact to digest receipts, and replay
has one checkpoint-aware normalization path. Focused web checks and the full
`pnpm ci:check` pass; generated and final diff audits have no remaining finding.

## Next safe action

Provision the next bounded conversation slice from clean current `main`:
durable FIFO queued-send state, restart recovery, explicit queue revisions, and
positive interruption receipts. Keep safe activity/tool lifecycle and runtime
selection outside that slice.

## Startup checks

```text
git status --short --branch
git worktree list --porcelain
git remote -v
git log --oneline --decorate -8
```

Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/master-plan.md`, `docs/current-state.md`, CF-001, the
BC-001 evidence, and the named boundary documents before continuing.

## Known blockers

No blocker. The Next shortcut code is isolated but has not been installed;
regular daily driving remains on the original PC-SDK until the migration gate.
