## Status

CF-004 is complete: closed honest activity, guarded safe tool lifecycle,
replayable approval state, strict live/HTTP transcript ingestion, and terminal
closure across normal, error, interrupt, recovery, kill, and shutdown paths are
verified and guarded-landed. The sealed implementation and feature record are
both proven ancestors of the landing merge; the landed tree exactly matches the
fully verified feature tree. The feature worktree is torn down. There is no
user-direction blocker.

## Next safe action

Define and provision the first bounded N3 slice: immutable runtime/account/
model/effort selection stamps on app sessions plus the minimum capability
contract needed to make continuation and selection changes honest. Prove the
shape with Claude before Codex, and keep context/quota widening out until the
session-selection invariant is guarded.

## Startup checks

```text
git status --short --branch
git worktree list --porcelain
git remote -v
git log --oneline --decorate -8
```

Run startup checks and read the N3 master-plan/runtime/account boundaries before
provisioning a new run-owned worktree. The main checkout remains read-only.

## Known blockers

No blocker. The Next shortcut code is isolated but has not been installed;
regular daily driving remains on the original PC-SDK until the migration gate.
